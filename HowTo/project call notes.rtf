id ranking\
good comparable results\
bounding boxes of fins\
larger sets -> quality may go down? could make quality judgement\
20,000 eventually\
error rate of id - no one knows, could try to clean up be eye\
data set is sharks seen on 5 separate occasions\
if only seen once could be unreliable so 5 reliable\
\
\
first simple fin detection\
1 image has wrong id in data set\
got pixel masks in dataset\
dont go through masking as a stage, but map id directly\
with masks can easily get fin, bounding box\'85\
labels - keypoints like tip\
\
add a bit of padding to bounding box to edges (5% margin?) less likely to miss fin\
\
bens current bounding box acc. rate is outstanding? 100% if ok fin?\
\
independent verification and comparison with two systems\

\
\
this year, the set is 1,100\
\
1) detector / bounding box of fins\
2) map straight from localised sub-region (bounding box?) to id\
 - use id from the images\
\
could eventually look for discrepency between ids?\
\
use lots of augmentation (could look at partial data)\
quit unbalanced dataset (e.g., one shark has 50, some have only 2 images)\

\
batch processing on blue crystal\
\
\
\
\
Consider: fin find R (not published) - IDs fins reasonably well - ignore\
